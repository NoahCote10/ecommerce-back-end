## Description <a name="description"></a>
This project was designed to reinforce the techniques used to create CRUD routes for back end management. I used sequelize, MySQL database, and insomnia to test these routes. I also created the columns for each table using the criteria provided, and established relationships between those tables within an index file.

A demonstration of the routes in this project can be viewed [here](assets/EcommerceBackEndDemo.mp4).
## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The repository for this assignment can be found [here]. You must also use Insomnia to test these routes, and have a MySQL database to store the data.
